# Modern Day Caste System

  Today, “persons, whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury” [1], face extreme wage discrimination. In more extreme cases, handicapped workers may earn a wage as low as $ 0.25 per hour in locations where local minimum wage surpasses the federal floor [2]. Franklin D Roosevelt signed these provisions when employers successfully lobbied to ease the minimum wage rate for handicapped workers during the Great Depression. As written by Fair Labors Standards Act, Section 14 (c) established employer’s ability to pay handicapped workers a special minimum wage as determined by the Secretary of Labor. These provisions also mentions the ability for employers to further isolate handicapped workers into work activities centers, also known as sheltered workshops [3]. Later, 1986 amendment further removed wage floor with the creation of a commensurate wage [4].

  Many special minimum wage employers falsify performance reviews. To quality for special minimum wage, employers must certify with a Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division [5]. When accepted, the employer must stipend the disabled worker relative to an non-disabled experienced worker [6]. However, employers seem to disparage their worker’s ability in order to trigger provisions to lower the wage floor [7]. International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation reports “from a 2008 survey that U.S. citizens working in sheltered workshops earned about $101/month and worked 74 hours a month” [8]. As given by the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, disabled workers lost a potential $435.50 a month at a prevailing wage of $7.25 per hour.

  Section 14 (c) fails to integrate disabled into the workforce. Instead of integrated environments, special minimum wage workers work in segregated facilities known as work activities center. Many of them would spend years to decades training in these centers [10] Furthermore, these facilities employ 95% of all special minimum wage workers and are subsidized by government contracts such as the Javitz-Wagner-O’Day Act [11]. Despite their training, only 5% of workers leave these centers to earn either special or at least minimum wage [12].

  These workshops train workers in skills which are somewhat irrelevant in the competitive world. Most work centers provide assembly line jobs to Section 14 (c) workers [13]. For example, UCO, tier 1 Honda supplier, ordered Mr. Denoewer to pack owner’s manuals into new cars on the isolated workstation named “the table” [14]. Section 14 (c) workers perform a wide variety of task such as assembling, cleaning, packing, sorting, etc but Samuel Bagenstos, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, argues “Section 14 (c) proposition that people with disabilities should have to provide their ability and inclination to work in whatever make - work jobs the workshops create before moving into the world of competitive employment” [15].

  Owners and managers pocket the difference. Snopes investigated Goodwill’s CEO, Jim Gibbons, made over $700,000 [16], a number endorsed by Goodwill [17]. Even if Section 14 (c) workers work in more integrated environments, some certificate holders exploit a common scheme to classify workers as employee of a sheltered workshop. Hawaii legislators documented “entities holding these special wage certificates can act as subcontractors for any other business” [18]. These workers toll away working the same job and under the same roof as non exempt workers while being classified as a subcontractor.

  The Supreme Court reinstated individual’s right to integrate into society. The Supreme Court elaborated unjust insitualiationzation is prohibited by ADA [19] in the Olmstead v L. C. Many state governments pinned this decision as their justification to ban sheltered workshops [20]. For example in New York, governor, Cuomo established Most Integrated Setting Coordinating Council to administer the Olmstead ruling [21]. MISCC celebrates their ability to reduce long term stay by 10% [22]. In addition, they celebrated client’s ability to pursue their own dream such as Jeremy’s passion to become a mechanic [23]. These findings are not unique. Robert Evert Cimera, Educational Foundations and Special Services, measured noticeably better outcomes for supported employees than sheltered environments [24].
